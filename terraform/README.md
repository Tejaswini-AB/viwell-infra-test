# Viwell Azure Infrastructure — Terraform

## One-time setup (do these before the first pipeline run)

### 1. Create the remote state storage account
```bash
az login
bash bootstrap/create-state-storage.sh
```
Creates `rg-tfstate-uaenorth-01` / `sttfstateuaenorth01` / container `tfstate`,
with blob versioning and 30-day soft delete enabled.

### 2. Add OIDC to your existing service principal
You already have an App Registration — add federated credentials to that
same one rather than creating a new one. Follow
**`bootstrap/MANUAL_APP_REGISTRATION_SETUP.md`** for the exact federated
credential subject strings the workflows require (these must match
precisely, or the OIDC token exchange fails at runtime), plus which values
go where in GitHub repo settings. Once confirmed working, the client secret
is no longer needed and can be deleted.

### 3. Configure GitHub repo settings
**Variables** (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables — not
secret, since OIDC needs no client secret):
| Name | Value |
|---|---|
| `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` | your service principal's client ID |
| `AZURE_TENANT_ID` | your tenant ID |
| `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` | your subscription ID |

Private DNS zones for PostgreSQL and Redis (`privatelink.postgres.database.azure.com`,
`privatelink.redis.cache.windows.net`) are now created and linked by Terraform
itself (`modules/private-dns-zone`) — no manual `az` commands or GitHub
variables needed for these anymore.

**Secrets** (same location, Secrets tab):
| Name | Value |
|---|---|
| `STAGING_POSTGRES_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | strong password, staging DB |
| `PRODUCTION_POSTGRES_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | strong password, prod DB |

You can remove `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` if you'd already added it — it's no
longer used once OIDC is in place.

**Environments** (Settings → Environments):
- Create `hub` — no protection rules needed; hub changes are infrequent
  (shared VNet/subnets) and auto-apply on merge like staging.
- Create `staging` — no protection rules needed, or a light one if you prefer.
- Create `production` — add **at least one required reviewer**. This is what
  makes `terraform apply` pause for manual approval on production changes.

## How the pipelines work

- **`.github/workflows/terraform-hub.yml`** — same plan/apply pattern as
  staging. Runs on pushes/PRs touching `environments/hub/**` or `modules/**`.
  Applies automatically on merge to `main` (Environment `hub`, no approval
  gate) since it only manages shared networking.
- **`.github/workflows/terraform-staging.yml`** — runs on GitHub-hosted
  `ubuntu-latest` runners. Pull requests touching `environments/staging/**`
  or `modules/**` get a `terraform plan` posted as a PR comment. Merging to
  `main` triggers `terraform apply` automatically (environment `staging`,
  no approval gate).
- **`.github/workflows/terraform-production.yml`** — same plan-on-PR flow,
  but the apply job runs under the `production` GitHub Environment, so it
  **pauses for manual approval** before touching production.
- Both use `permissions: id-token: write` and `ARM_USE_OIDC: "true"` — no
  client secret is stored or transmitted anywhere.

## Local development

```bash
cp backend-config.hcl.example backend-config.hcl   # gitignored, edit if needed
az login
cd environments/staging
terraform init -backend-config=../../backend-config.hcl
export TF_VAR_subscription_id="<sub-id>"
export TF_VAR_postgres_administrator_password="<local-secret>"
terraform plan
```
Local auth falls back to `az login` (Azure CLI auth) since `use_oidc = true`
only activates when the OIDC environment variables GitHub Actions sets are
present; locally, the provider uses your `az` session instead.

## Repo layout
```
modules/            # reusable resource modules
environments/
  hub/               # shared hub VNet
  staging/           # non-prod workloads
  production/        # prod workloads, zone-resilient
bootstrap/           # one-time az cli setup scripts (not run by CI)
.github/workflows/   # CI/CD pipelines
```
